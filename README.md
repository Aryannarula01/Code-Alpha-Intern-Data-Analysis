📊 IPL Data Analysis & Visualization – CodeAlpha Internship (Task 2 & 3)
👨‍💻 Internship Domain: Data Analytics
📝 Tasks Covered:
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Task 3: Data Visualization

🧠 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship with CodeAlpha in the Data Analytics domain. The goal was to analyze and visualize IPL data using Python. I used matches.csv and deliveries.csv from the official IPL dataset.

✅ What I Did – Task Breakdown
🔍 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored the structure of both datasets (rows, columns, data types)

Cleaned missing/null values using fillna() and dropna()

Merged match data with ball-by-ball data for deeper insights

Asked meaningful questions and answered them using code

Validated assumptions (e.g., toss winner ≠ match winner always)

Found the highest run scorer of all time and per season

Identified players with most sixes and fours

Detected data inconsistencies and corrected them

📊 Task 3: Data Visualization
Created various visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Visualized:

Top 10 run scorers in IPL history

Toss decision distribution (bat vs field)

Top 10 six-hitters and four-hitters

Most matches won by teams

Top run scorer in each season (line plot)

Focused on clear, readable, and meaningful charts

📂 Dataset Used
matches.csv: Match-level data (teams, toss, winner, venue, etc.)

deliveries.csv: Ball-by-ball data (batter, bowler, runs, extras, etc.)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📌 Key Insights
🏏 Virat Kohli is the highest run-scorer in IPL history and in a single season (973 runs in 2016).

💥 Chris Gayle has hit the most sixes in IPL history.

🎯 Most teams prefer to field first after winning the toss.

🟡 Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings dominate the win count.
